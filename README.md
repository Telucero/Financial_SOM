## Introduction

In this project, I implement a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) using Python, specifically focusing on constructing an artificial neural network to analyze and cluster financial dataset. The SOM is a type of artificial neural network trained using unsupervised learning, commonly employed for tasks such as dimensionality reduction, visualization, and clustering. By utilizing SOM, my aim is to identify patterns, relationships, and general information within the financial dataset.

## Project Description

The project involves several key steps:

Data Loading & Preprocessing: I load the financial dataset, perform exploratory data analysis, handle missing values, and preprocess the data for model training.

Model Construction: I define the functions and classes necessary for constructing the SOM. This includes initializing the SOM, training the model, and evaluating its performance using metrics such as Quantization Error and Topological Error.

Visualization: I visualize the trained SOM to analyze and interpret the clusters and patterns captured by the model.

## Data Analysis

I conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the financial dataset, including visualizations such as pair plots, correlation heatmaps, and box plots to understand the distribution and relationships between different features. Additionally, I perform data preprocessing steps such as scaling and encoding categorical variables to prepare the data for model training.

## Technologies Used

The technologies I utilized in this project include:

Python programming language
Libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization
